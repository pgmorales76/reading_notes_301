# Class 02 Reading Notes

## Why This Topic Matters

### 

## **Reading**

## *Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘`render`’ or the ‘`componentDidMount`’?*

### `render`

## *What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?*

### During the "Mounting Phase", an instance of a component is created and inserted in the DOM

## *Put the following things in the order that they happen: `componentDidMount`, `render`, `constructor` , `componentWillUnmount`, `React Updates`.*

### `constructor`, `render`, `React Updates`, `componentDidMount`, and `componentWillUnmount`

## *What does `componentDidMount` do?*

> This method is invoked immediately after a component is mounted. If you need to load anything using a network request or initialize the DOM, it should go here. This method is a good place to set up any subscriptions. If you do that, don’t forget to unsubscribe in componentWillUnmount().
