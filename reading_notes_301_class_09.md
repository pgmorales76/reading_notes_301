## *What is functional programming?*

> Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)

## *What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?*

- It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as `deterministic`)

- It does not cause any observable side effects

## *What are the benefits of a pure function?*

### Because the code is easier to test, you don't need to mock anything. Therefore, pure functions may be unit tested in different contexts

## *What is immutability?*

### Data whose state is unchanging over time, or unable to be changed. Instead of changing immutable data, you must create a new object, with a new value

## *What is Referential transparency?*

> Basically, if a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.
