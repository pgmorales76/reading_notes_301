| SQL          | NoSQL        |
| :---:        | :---:        |
| Primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS) | Primarily called as non-relational or distributed database |
| Table-based databases | Document based, key-value pairs, graph databases, or wide-column stores |
| Predefined schema | Dynamic schema for unstructured data |
| Databases are vertically scalable | Horizontally scalable |
| Uses SQL (Structured Query Language) for defining and manipulating the data | Queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes, it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language). The syntax of using UnQL varies from database to database. |
