# Class 11 Reading Notes

## Why This Topic Matters

### Understanding the type of data you're working with enables the developer to determine the proper type of database to use

## Reading

## *Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:*

| SQL          | NoSQL        |
| :---:        | :---:        |
| Primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS) | Primarily called as non-relational or distributed database |
| Table-based databases | Document-based, key-value pairs, graph databases, or wide-column stores |
| Predefined schema | Dynamic schema for unstructured data |
| Databases are vertically scalable | Horizontally scalable |
| Uses SQL (Structured Query Language) for defining and manipulating the data | Queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes, it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language). The syntax of using UnQL varies from database to database. |

## *What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?*

### Data that's highly structured and associations among the program entities are clearly defined

## *Give a real world example.*

## *What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?*

### Data that's highly unstructured and relationships among the data entities aren't clearly defined

## *Give a real world example.*

## *Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?*

> NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data. NoSQL database are highly preferred for large data set (i.e for big data). Hbase is an example for this purpose.

## *Which type of database is best for scalability?*

> In most typical situations, SQL databases are vertically scalable. You can manage increasing load by increasing the CPU, RAM, SSD, etc, on a single server. On the other hand, NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. You can just add few more servers easily in your NoSQL database infrastructure to handle the large traffic.
