# Class 06 Reading Notes

## Why This Topic Matters

### Node and npm are important technologies that work in background to enable JavaScript to work on our machines

### Pair programming is an important skill, and working environment style, which prepares devs for their everday work life

## *What is node.js?*

### It's a Javascript runtime program that can be used to run JavaScript on the computer

## *In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?*

### It's a JavaScript engine that runs in web browsers. It compiles JavaScript that the computer can run

## *What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?*

### A specific version of the V8 engine

## *What is npm?*

### Node Package Manager. It's a JavaScript Package Manager and a softwatre registry

## *What version of node are you running on your machine?*

### `v19.3.0`

## *What version of npm are you running on your machine?*

### `9.2.0`

## *What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?*

### `npm install -g jshint`

## *What is node used for?*

### It compiles JavaScript to native machine code that the computer can run and is used to write JavaScript in the most compatible syntax

## *What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?*

### Greater efficiency, Engaged collaboration, Learning from fellow students, Social skills, Job interview readiness, and Work environment readiness

## *In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?*

### I would say the first three have been most beneficial to me because I've never had a job interview for software development, let alone being in a work environment that involved software development.

## *How does pair programming work?*

### Two, or more (I guess you can have more, but not less, than two?), devs work on code. One is the "driver", the person who types out code. The other is the "navigator", the person who tells the "driver" what code to type

## Things I Want to Know More About

### Are node and npm technologies we should understand, or should we just know they're used, in the background, and not study it, further?
