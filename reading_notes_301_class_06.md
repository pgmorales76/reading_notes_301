# Class 06 Reading Notes

## Why This Topic Matters

### Interacting with a team is what developers do every day. Learning what makes a great team (and what makes an individual a great team member) is necessary to performing any project, large or small

###

## *To what extent did psychological safety impact your previous work experience?*

### Most of my, recent, professional experience has been in a construction site setting. I can’t think of an environment where psychological safety is the least of their concerns!

### Now, to play devil’s advocate, for a moment, I think the reason for that is because physical safety is of paramount importance. Physical injury is more costly on a construction site, than if someone’s feelings get hurt. That’s the way the business is, for better or worse

### To the extent where working in a team is the environment in which you operate, there may be some give-and-take as to the details of the work being done

## *How does this article inform your approach to working with others moving forward?*

### When possible, I'll employ the three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams:

> Members speaking in the same proportion, a phenomenon researchers refer to as ‘‘equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking’’; high ‘‘average social sensitivity’’ — a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues; and making sure teams had clear goals and creating a culture of dependability.

###

## *What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?*

## Things I Want to Know More About

### It seems a bit cliché to have one team of “all-stars” and a team of “regular Joe’s”, with the latter having more success. I mean, it seems like a story out of a lame movie. Why did Google choose the teams the way they did? Why not make the teams more similar, than dissimilar?

### I find it difficult to believe that having a team of competent people is worse than having a team who “gets along”

### 

### How do I explain REST to my brother, when I don't have a brother?
